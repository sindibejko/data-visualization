# How does income influence student spending?
This project looks into the spending patterns and income sources of university students in the United States, using a dataset that consists of imaginary data. It highlights budget imbalances in universities, particularly in lower income brackets, suggesting a need for more tailored and increased financial support or budgeting assistance.

## Graphs of Analysis
1. Monthly Spending vs. Income by Income Brackets
2. Average Monthly Income by Year in School
3. Spending on Essentials vs. Lifestyle by Income Brackets
4. Distribution of Lifestyle Spending by Category (Lower-Middle & Low Incomes)

## Key Insights
- **Budget Imbalance**: Lower income students often exceed their budgets, indicating a need for financial support or better budgeting.
- **Decreasing Parental Support**: Financial support from parents decreases as students progress in their studies.
- **Consistent Essential Spending**: Essential spending is consistent across income brackets, while lifestyle spending varies significantly.
- **High Lifestyle Spending in Lower Incomes**: Significant spending on technology and miscellaneous items among lower income students suggests a focus on non-essential needs.
