# Teaching Hours Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the distribution and trends of teaching hours across various subjects and departments using Tableau. The dataset, "**teaching_hours**", provides insights into how teaching hours are allocated and how they vary over time, by day, and among different student groups.

## Objectives
- Visualize the distribution of teaching hours by different categories.
- Identify trends in teaching hours.
- Compare teaching hours across different subjects and departments.
- Understand the allocation of teaching hours among students.

## Key Visualizations & Observations
1. **Total Hours Taught by Day of the Week**: Sunday has the highest teaching hours, while Friday has the lowest.
2. **Total Hours Taught by Subject**: Math and Biology have the highest teaching hours, while Algebra has the least.
3. **Total Hours Taught by Students**: F. Nunez received significantly more teaching hours than other students.
4. **Monthly Hours per Year**: There is a noticeable increase in teaching hours during certain months each year.
5. **Yearly Hours per Subject**: Biology and Math consistently have high teaching hours across the years.
6. **Monthly Number of Different Students**: The number of students varies, with peaks observed in certain months.
7. **Students per Grade**: The distribution of students in different grades fluctuates, with noticeable trends over the years.
8. **Students per Grade per Quarter**: Variations in student counts are evident across different quarters and grades.
9. **Number of Lessons per Weekday and Hour**: Certain hours and days have higher concentrations of lessons.
10. **Weekly Hours Taken by Student F. Nunez**: F. Nunez's teaching hours have periodic spikes, indicating intense study periods.

## So what?
This analysis reveals patterns in how teaching hours are distributed and utilized. By identifying which days, subjects, and students receive the most teaching hours, educational institutions can:
- Optimize class schedules to distribute teaching loads throughout the week better.
- Allocate more resources to subjects and students that need more attention.
- Recognize periods of high teaching activity to support teachers and students during these times better.
- Adjust teaching strategies to ensure a balanced distribution of teaching hours across all subjects and student groups.

These insights can lead to more efficient use of teaching resources, improved student performance, and a better overall educational experience.
